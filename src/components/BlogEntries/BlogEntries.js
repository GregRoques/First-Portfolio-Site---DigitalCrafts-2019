                    Thanks for stopping by my revamped website. I am going to keep this brief (particularly as this post began as lorem ipsum filler for this layout), however I would like to invite you to check back in the coming weeks as I plan to post regularly about new projects I am working on and lessons learned in the fields of front-end development and graphic design.

                    In the meantime, you can check out my GitHub <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href='https://github.com/GregRoques/Portfolio-Take-2/blob/master/README.md'>Read Me</a> for this site to learn about some of the challenges I encountered building this website and the solutions I devised. I hope this may be helpful to you.
